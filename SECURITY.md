## Security Features

Enterprise Agent includes several built-in security features:

### 🔒 Core Security Features
- **Zero Trust Execution**: All agent operations run in isolated environments
- **ML Vulnerability Detection**: AI-powered detection of security issues in code
- **Supply Chain Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of agent behavior patterns
- **Secrets Detection**: Automated detection of hardcoded secrets and credentials

### 🛡️ Security Controls
- **Configuration Validation**: All configuration inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Information Filtering**: Sensitive information is filtered from error messages
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all security-relevant operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse and resource exhaustion
- **Input Sanitization**: All external inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks

### 🔐 Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data is encrypted when stored
- **Secure Communication**: All API communications use encrypted channels
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory after use
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access controls for different operations

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly through one of these channels:

### Preferred Method: Security Advisory
1. Go to the Security tab of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form
4. Include as much detail as possible

### Alternative Method: Email
Send an email to: **security@your-org.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested mitigation strategies
- Your contact information for follow-up

## Response Process

### Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of report
- **Confirmation**: Within 48 hours if vulnerability is confirmed

- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- **Response Time**: Immediate (within 4 hours)
- **Fix Timeline**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Examples**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Within 1 week
- **Examples**: Privilege escalation, data exposure

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Within 2 weeks
- **Examples**: Information disclosure, denial of service

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- **Response Time**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Next scheduled release
- **Examples**: Minor information leakage, low-impact issues

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines
3. **Access Controls**: Implement proper access controls for your deployment
4. **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and audit logging
5. **Secrets Management**: Use secure secret management solutions

### For Developers
1. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Code Review**: Ensure security review of all code changes
4. **Testing**: Include security testing in your test suite
5. **Documentation**: Document security considerations

### Configuration Security

#### Secure Configuration Example
```yaml
# Security-focused configuration
security:
  features:
    - zero_trust_execution
    - ml_vulnerability_detection
    - supply_chain_scanning
    - behavioral_monitoring
  gates:
    pre_merge_gate: enabled
    swarm_level_checks: enabled

observability:
  metrics:
    collect_security_metrics: true
  audit_logging:
    enabled: true
    level: detailed
    retention_days: 90
```

### Secrets Management
- **Never commit secrets**: API keys, tokens, or credentials must never be in code
- **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive data in `.env` files (never commit these)
- **Reference .env.example**: Document required variables without exposing values
- **Credential rotation**: Rotate API keys and tokens regularly

### Claude API Security
- **Subscription mode preferred**: Use Claude Code CLI with Max subscription to avoid API charges
- **API key protection**: If using API mode, store `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` securely
- **Rate limiting**: Implement timeouts and retries to prevent abuse
- **Cost monitoring**: Track token usage through the CostEstimator module

### Data Protection
- **PII scrubbing**: All logs automatically scrub personally identifiable information
- **Retention policy**: Logs retained for 30 days by default
- **Secure storage**: Use encrypted storage for sensitive data
- **Access control**: Limit repository access to authorized personnel only

### Code Security
- **Dependency scanning**: Regularly update dependencies with `poetry update`
- **Static analysis**: Run `bandit` for security vulnerability detection
- **Code review**: All PRs require review before merging to main
- **Testing**: Maintain >95% code coverage with security-focused tests

### CI/CD Security
- **GitHub Secrets**: Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD credentials
- **Protected branches**: Enable branch protection rules for main
- **Signed commits**: Consider requiring GPG-signed commits
- **Audit logging**: Enable GitHub audit logs for security events
